# Obsidian Relative Line Numbers - CM6

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin enables relative line numbers in Obsidian's CodeMirror 6 editor (Obsidian v13+). 

To use this plugin,
- Line numbers must be enabled (`Options/Show Line Number`)
- Legacy (CM5) editor is not enabled

Under the hood, this plugin simply adds jsjoeio's [codemirror-line-numbers-relative](https://github.com/jsjoeio/codemirror-line-numbers-relative) extension to the editor and tweaks CSS to minimize reflow.

This plugin was inspired by Nadav Spiegelman's CM5 [relative line numbers extension](https://github.com/nadavspi/obsidian-relative-line-numbers), but is not affiliated with or a fork of that project.
